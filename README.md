# Blueprint

# Essential plan
1.0 Header </br>
2.0 - 2.3 Body </br>
3.0 Footer </br>
</br>
Then possibly modify/add up the footer's link page.
</br>
Do not hold this more than two days or switch back to the previous react portfolio project and fix/update unnatural parts.

# Extra plan
1. The space-style background is somewhat not that unique. Modify it and prove the ability of my FE skill.
2. Looks like I can challenge to shape all project cover page to display it as a form of sector style. 1) Animate it 2) Link it to project github page.
Otherwise, just create own project only page to let visitor can visit and check each project I have made so far.
3. The page footer's link may be eliminated. Then insert email button instead.
